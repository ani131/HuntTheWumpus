To run the program, navigate to App.java and run the main method. 

Once you run it, a screen should pop up with buttons saying “Instructions”, “Easy”, “Medium”, 
and “Hard”. 

If you are unfamiliar with the game, click instructions, read them thoroughly, 
and then close the instructions tab. Then select the button associated with the 
gamemode you want to choose. Once selected the game should pop up and you can play as 
instructed. 

Once you finish the game, it will close and you can choose to play the 
same gamemode or pick a new one. You can also choose to revisit the instructions as needed.
